# hello-world
my first try at GitHub, and I believe later it will become a place where I record my ideas.
hope things went well.I am just a student majoring statistics at ECNU and that's all.

and this is about 2 years later, I have finally got the time and determination to make the move. :) Can I just not procrastinate.
